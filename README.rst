librarian
=========

Librarian is an archive manager for Outernet Receiver. 

It reads the content of a directory where the content has been downloaded from 
the satellite receiver, and allows the user to sort, remove, and accept new
content into the Outernet Receiver's content archive. It also provides an
interface for browsing the archive. Finally, it provides mechanisms for
self-updating.

The current version does not provide any search capability. That feature is
planned for future releases.

We chose to use Arch Linux as development.

Development environment and running Librarian
=============================================

Please see the documentation in ``docs/dev_env.rst``.

Contributing interface translations
===================================

You can either translate using the .po files in the project directory, or use
the hosted version `on POEditor`_ (recommended). Note that Librarian is
currently under active development, so strings *will* change from time to time.

If you are contributing, or considering contributing translations, please swing
by our forums_ and say hello.
